# UI-fundamentals

I decided to design a portfolio for a designer.
I made it simple and just wanted to design something not to complicated so that I could showcase each concept easily.
Designing a portfolio for a designer - it is important that the overall website feels trustworthy, creative and playful, because future clients will be thinking about that. It should look professional and be easy on the eyes. As a designer, you want the visitor to spend as much time on your website as you can.


<h3>Whitespace</h3>
  For the viewer to be able to "breathe" while on the website I made sure to have enough whitespace around all the elements.
  It is important to have enough whitespace so that the first impression for the visitor on the website will be better and to keep him on the website longer.

<h3>Alignment</h3>
  I made a boarder on the left and right of the frame so that I would not put elements too close to the boarder. You can see the borders as the red lines I made from the ruler. With them I can make sure that the elements touch it on each side and that will make the structure of the website much better and visible appealing.

<h3>Contrast</h3>
  Contrast can be different.

<h3>Color</h3>
  The color scheme I chose for this design contains blue as the primay color, orange for highlights and white and black as additional colors.
  Blue is usually associated with open spaces, imagination, and inspiration. Blue also represents meanings of trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability and intelligence. I used blue for the background as well but with only 3% oppacity
  Orange is associated with enthusiasmt, creativity, fun and success. In addition to that orange is the opposite color of blue from the color wheel which makes it stand out even more. Hence why its for highlights.
  
<h3>Scale</h3>
  

<h3>Proximity</h3>
I added in the second frame red boxes to show how I used proximity to part each section.
Each element for its section is closer together while there is more space between sections.


<h3>Typography</h3>
I used Segoe UI as the typeface for this design. Its name basically says User Interface (UI). It is intended to improve the consistency in how users see all text across all languages, which would make it great it the website had different languages to choose from. The font has alot of variations to pick from f.x. semibold/semilightt/black/light and more. It's a sans serif font which makes it open and friendly.

<h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
Color and contrast: I made the contact button on the nav bar blue to highlight him from the others. In the "about me" section I also made the buttons contrast.
Scale: The name "Jane Doe" should catch the viewers attention firstly. Because as a designers that your brand name and you want that recognized. That's why it't the biggest element when you first open the website.
