# UI-fundamentals




<h3>Whitespace
  For the viewer to be able to "breathe" while on the website I made sure to have enough whitespace around all the elements.
  With whitespace, the more the better the design will be.

<h3>Alignment
  I made a boarder on the left and right of the frame so that I would not put elements too close to the boarder. You can see the borders as the red lines.
  With that you can see that the elements touch it and that makes the structure much better of the website and therefore it's more visible appealing to scroll through it.

<h3>Contrast
  Contrast can be different.

<h3>Color
  The color scheme I chose for this design is blue as the primay color, orange for highlights and white and black as additional colors.
  Blue is usually associated with open spaces, imagination, and inspiration. Blue also represents meanings of trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability and intelligence.
  Orange is associated with enthusiasmt, creativity, fun and success.
  In addition to that orange is the opposite color of blue from the color wheel which makes it stand out even more. Hence why its for highlights.
